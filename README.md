**DEPRECATED**: I don't maintain this anymore, and it probably doesn't
work. If you want a pull-request bot for Slack, I'd recommend the
[MOJ's Slack PR bot](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/slack-prbot).

PR Bot
======

A simple script for announcing open pull requests across all repositories
for a given GitHub team.

It only works with HipChat for the moment, and requires `GH_TOKEN`
(GitHub auth token) and `HC_TOKEN` (HipChat auth token) environment
variables.
